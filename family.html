            <h1>Meet the Family</h1>
            <p>I was born and raised in a small town called Bloomington, California where I lived
            in a single room of my grandma's house with my mom, dad, sister, and family pet for the
            first eleven years of my life. Our family, as long as I can remember, has always been poor
            but along with that poverty, we have always been hihgly dedicated to one another's success.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It is due to my parent's dedication to me that I have developed into the driven, ambitious, and 
            dedicated person I am today. I have included some pictures of my family (both personal and work family)
            below so you can get to know them better:</p>
